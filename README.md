## 2024 retrospective

* Made it through day 14 and part 1 of day 15 before the advent code stopped being fun and started being too time consuming
* The first few days were simple and Python was a fine language.  Around Day 10 I should have switched to a more robust language such as Rust.  Next year I will start with Rust.
* I for some reason did not realize that a Python dict could take Tuple keys.  This would have made my code simpler and easier to reason about.
* Day 7 is the code I'm most proud of.  
* I got ahead of myself Day 10, essentially misreading the instructions and solved Part 2 for Part 1.  Once I realized this mistake, it at least made Part 2 trivial
* Day 13 I spent too much time seeing how "close" floats were to ints. I should have implemented a checker for the solver and compared to the answer much sooner.
